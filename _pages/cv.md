## 1. Supply Chain Finance Project for Yinan Yunqin Technology Company

**Background:** With 25% of the country's poultry production, Yinan County is regarded as the pillar county for national poultry processing in China. Yinan's chattel supply chain presently contributes 70% of the county's total GDP, which exceeds 2 billion dollars. However, many poultry companies in Yinan, particularly small and medium-sized companies like startup businesses, continue to grow slowly and consistently run into financial difficulties.

<center>Figure 1: Financial difficulties of many startup poultry companies in Yinan</center>

The primary cause of this funding shortage is the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">low credit</span> of these startup poultry companies. Given the inadequacy of assessable assets and financing amount of these companies, financial institutions are less motivated to offer these businesses supply chain finance services because of a disproportion on their input and output efforts. Additionally, there are still many systemic problems and structural issues in the current guarantee systems, which are vulnerable in risk resistence when the bad loans of some start-ups emerge. 

We, the [Shenzhen Finance Institute (SFI)](https://sfi.cuhk.edu.cn/en) system analysis group, are fortunate to have been given the opportunity by the China Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (CASME) to provide the supply chain financial service of a startup company called <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Yinan Yunqin Technology Company</span> to resolve their financial issues and construct a risk management information system for both Yunan and financial institutions to prevent the aforementioned credit risk.

**Project Description:** In this project, we establish the supply chain finance approach in two key terms: <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">chattel mortgage financing</span> and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">accounts receivable financing</span>, which make it easier for Yinan Yunqin Technology company to finance and reduce the potential risk of financial institutions at the same time.

$\color{DarkGoldenRod}{(1)}$ <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Chattel mortgage financing:</span> In the chattel mortgage financing service, when the Yunqin stockyard have a financial need, the financial institution can set the frozen stocks of the stockyard as mortgage in the $3^{\textrm{rd}}$ party warehouse. The main steps of chattel mortgage financing are shown as follows,

Firstly, the stockyard makes finance applications to our CASME Platform for matching appropriate financial institutions (①). Then, the CASME assists in matching financial institutions that are prepared to finance and introduces the primary financing process to the partner agency of the matched institutions (②). After credit checking, the financial institution works along with a third-party warehouse that manages the stockyard's mortgage until the financial contract expires (③④). 

$③$ Financial institutions indirectly entrust credit authorities or directly make credit checking for the stockyard to figure out whether it fulfills the minimum credit standards of lending.

$④$ Financial institutions cooperate with 3rd party warehouse which supervises the mortgage of the stockyard until the financial contract ends.

$⑤$ After cooperation, the stockyard is asked to provide the mortgage with the same value as lending capital to pledge in the warehouse until repayment.

$⑥$ Financial institutions and stockyards reach an agreement and issue the contract through our CASME Platform.

$⑦$ To attract more financial institutions to join our platform, we purchase bad loan risk insurance for each financial institution engaged. Once a bad loan emerges, the insurance company will make compensation for the financial institution.

$⑧$ Financial institutions grant credit and provide capital to the stockyard.

$⑨$ The stockyard purchases necessary production material (i.e., forage) with lending capital.

$⑩$ According to the financial contract, the stockyard should make repayments before the given date.

$⑪$ If the stockyard repays on time, the frozen mortgage will be released. Otherwise, all the mortgages may be liquidated by the financial institution.

$⑫$ The financial institution ends the contract with the 3rd party warehouse.

$⑬$ The financial institution ends the contract with the stockyard through CASME Platform.

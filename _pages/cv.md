## 1. Supply Chain Finance Project for Yinan Yunqin Technology Company

**Background:** With 25% of the country's poultry production, Yinan County is regarded as the pillar county for national poultry processing in China. Yinan's chattel supply chain presently contributes 70% of the county's total GDP, which exceeds 2 billion dollars. However, many poultry companies in Yinan, particularly small and medium-sized companies like startup businesses, continue to grow slowly and consistently run into financial difficulties.

The primary cause of this funding shortage is the low credit of these startup poultry companies. Given the inadequacy of assessable assets and financing amount of these companies, financial institutions are less motivated to offer these businesses supply chain finance services because of a disproportion on their input and output efforts. Additionally, there are still many systemic problems and structural issues in the current guarantee systems, which are vulnerable in risk resistent when the bad loans of some start-ups emerge.

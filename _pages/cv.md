## 1. Supply Chain Finance Project for Yinan Yunqin Technology Company

**Background:** With 25% of the country's poultry production, Yinan County is regarded as the pillar county for national poultry processing in China. Yinan's chattel supply chain presently contributes 70% of the county's total GDP, which exceeds 2 billion dollars. However, many poultry companies in Yinan, particularly small and medium-sized companies like startup businesses, continue to grow slowly and consistently run into financial difficulties. 

<div align=center><img src=" /images/07.png " width="65%"></div>

<center>Figure 1: Financial difficulties of many startup poultry companies in Yinan</center>

The primary cause of this funding shortage is the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">low credit</span> of these startup poultry companies. Given the inadequacy of assessable assets and financing amount of these companies, financial institutions are less motivated to offer these businesses supply chain finance services because of a <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">disproportion</span> on their input and output efforts. Additionally, there are still many systemic problems and structural issues in the current guarantee systems, which are vulnerable in risk resistence when the bad loans of some start-ups emerge. 

We, the [Shenzhen Finance Institute (SFI)](https://sfi.cuhk.edu.cn/en) system analysis group, are fortunate to have been given the opportunity by the [China Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (CASME)](http://www.ca-sme.org/) to provide the supply chain financial service for a startup company called <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Yinan Yunqin Technology Company</span> to resolve their financial issues and construct a <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">risk management information system</span> for both Yunan and financial institutions to prevent the aforementioned credit risk.

**Project Description:** In this project, we establish the supply chain finance approach in two primary terms: <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">chattel mortgage financing</span> and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">accounts receivable financing</span>, which make it easier for Yinan Yunqin Technology company to finance and reduce the potential risk of financial institutions at the same time.

$\color{DarkGoldenRod}{(1)}$ <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Chattel Mortgage Financing:</span> In the chattel mortgage financing service, when the Yunqin stockyard have a financial need, the financial institution can set the frozen stocks of the stockyard as mortgage in the third-party warehouse. The main steps of chattel mortgage financing are shown as follows,


<div align=center><img src=" /images/08.png " width="80%"></div>

<center>Figure 2:  Chattel Mortgage Financing Model</center>

Firstly, the stockyard makes finance applications to our CASME Platform for matching appropriate financial institutions <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod"><font size=3>$(①)$</font></span>. Then, the CASME assists in matching financial institutions that are prepared to finance and introduces the primary financing process to the partner agency of the matched institutions <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod"><font size=3>$(②)$</font></span>. After credit checking, the financial institution works along with a third-party warehouse that manages the stockyard's mortgage until the financial contract expires <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod"><font size=3>$(③④)$</font></span>. Following agreement, the stockyard is requested to give a mortgage for the same amount as the loan's capital, which will be deposited in the warehouse until repayment <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod"><font size=3>$(⑤⑥)$</font></span>. To entice more financial institutions to join this project, the CASME buys bad loan risk insurance for each financial institution enrolled in this platform. The insurance provider will reimburse the financial institution when a bad loan materializes <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod"><font size=3>$(⑦)$</font></span>. Then, the financial institution provides the stockyard with funds so that the stockyard are capable to purchase necessary production materials <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod"><font size=3>$(⑧⑨)$</font></span>. Ultimately, the stockyard pays off the loan and receives the mortgage before the deadline, and the financial institution cancels its agreement with the third-party warehouse and CASME. Otherwise, the financial institution can liquidate all of the mortgages <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod"><font size=3>$(⑩⑪⑫⑬)$</font></span>.

A special case for chattel mortgage finance is <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Forage Finance</span> shown in Figure 3. We encourage the financial institution to work with forage shops (or other similar businesses) so that financial institutions can directly finance stockyard <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">forage</span> instead of <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">capital</span>, in order to avoid the stockyard from claiming the value of loan capital consumption to exceed real credit. Through this approach, financial institutions would only be responsible for making repayments to the forage shop once the stockyard had declared their production-level requirements.

<div align=center><img src=" /images/09.png " width="80%"></div>

<center>Figure 3:  Forage Financing Model</center>

$\color{DarkGoldenRod}{(2)}$ <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Accounts Receivable Financing:</span> Much like the chattel mortgage financing service, the accounts receivable financing service also provides stockyard financing solutions shown in Figure 4.  In order to enhance the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">liquidity</span> of mortgage, the collateral is changed from <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">frozen inventories</span> to <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">accounts receivable of downstream clients</span>. However, this service largely depends on the development and use of <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">information accounting systems</span>; otherwise, the operational risk of accounts receivable monitoring and retracing exists.

<div align=center><img src=" /images/10.png " width="80%"></div>

<center>Figure 4:  Accounts Receivable Financing Model</center>

Even with the aforementioned supply chain finance approaches, this platform still faces some significant difficulties as shown in Figure 5. Firstly, it might be difficult for other supply chain participants to be aware of some existing transactions between different parties, so the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">information sharing</span> is <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">insufficient</span>. Furthermore, it is also challenging to spot fraud since not all of the organizations disclose the transactions.

<div align=center><img src=" /images/11.png " width="75%"></div>

<center>Figure 5:  Data Flow Graph without Blockchain</center>

Therefore, an updated platform must be developed to enable transparency in data exchange and information sharing. <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Blockchain technology</span> can be leveraged to create a supply chain financial platform to address the issue of insufficient data sharing. The blockchain's <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">distributed</span> and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">decentralized</span> characteristics facilitate audits and monitoring, and its <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">immutability</span> also aids financial institutions in risk management.

<div align=center><img src=" /images/12.png " width="50%"></div>

<center>Figure 6:  Data Flow Graph with Blockchain</center>

After integrating <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">blockchain</span> with the existing system, we can find several benefits from the information flow in Figure 6 and the issues we previously discussed can be resolved. Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain and is <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">traceable</span> since the blockchain platform receives all the transaction data. As a result, <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">any</span> companies can readily request <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">access</span> and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">query</span> to all transaction records, which enhances the trust among all the parties. In the meanwhile, if any fraud or error occurs, all the information can be traced, allowing us to determine who should be held accountable. 

**Project Achievements:** The main achievements of this project can be summarized as follows.

1. With <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">blockchain technology</span>, developed an integrated supply chain finance and risk management information system for YunQin and related upstream and downstream companies in the poultry supply chain, from which successfully managed financing transactions in a <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">low risk</span> way throughout the entire supply chain, including the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">electronization</span> of accounts receivables, creditor's rights, repayment, inventory management, etc.

2. Realized the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">synergistic benefits</span>, <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">information transparency</span> and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">effective resource exchanges</span> (more resources with more enterprises engaging in the future) among the poultry companies, suppliers, and financial institutions, which helped YunQin overcome its financial crisis and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">boost</span> its overall profit by <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">65%</span> over the first two quarters of 2021.

3. This project has been scored as <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">5.00/5.00</span> by the advisor Mr. Shen Zhenyuan from CASME.

## 2. AI-driven P2P Financial Risk Management Project of Lending Club

**Background:** Peer-to-peer lending (P2P) business, is a practice of lending money to individuals or businesses through online services that match lenders with borrowers. P2P lending company earns a profit from providing the match-making platform and setting interests.

<div align=center><img src=" /images/13.png " width="80%"></div>

<center>Figure 1:  Business Model of P2P Lending Platform</center>

However, the P2P business has encountered a significant number of defaulting cases from 2014 to 2019, which always causes serious financial catastrophes. The primary causes are the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">miscalculation</span> of credits and the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">immaturity</span> of the credit inquiry system. Even the world largest P2P company, <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">the Lending Club</span>, was not immune from this crisis. Lending Club provided us with information showing that, by the end of June 2018, there had been over <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">8500</span> cases of lending fraud reported. The related loss was over <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">800 million</span> dollars, and the cases' victims totaled over <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">2 million</span>. 

To address their issues with risk management, the Lending Club consulted the collaborative team from the [Data Science and Information Technology Research Center](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/english/4993/list.htm) of [Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI)](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/english/main.htm) and the Big Data Center of [Ascending Powers Company](https://www.power2tech.com), a data mining company dominated by the alumni of [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). As the deep learning intern in the Big Data Research & Development Team of Ascending Powers, I'm fortunate to engage in this project and responsible for designing AI-driven financing and risk management approaches.

**Project Description:** In this project, the main challenges and flaws shown by the aforementioned fraud incidents for the Lending Club lie in 3 aspects: <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">credit risk</span>, <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">mortgage risk</span>, and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">account risk</span>.

$\color{DarkGoldenRod}{(1)}$ <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Credit Risk:</span> Even though Lending Club has developed a number of algorithms for calculating credit based on experience and machine learning, the majority of them are <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">offline</span> methods calculating massive data in a slow and ineffective way. Furthermore, despite the employment of these techniques, there is still a serious mismatch phenomena, in which many people and businesses with <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">legitimate needs</span> for financing are unable to do so because of <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">"poor credit"</span>, while others with problematic debts are still be granted with credit. 

Additionally, the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">interest rates</span> that are set and offered to borrowers are always based on <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">experience</span>, which shows a tendency to be <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">overestimated</span>. Due to the high interest rates, more current borrowers are defaulting on loans and fewer potential borrowers are attracted to take out loans on P2P platforms.

$\color{DarkGoldenRod}{(2)}$ <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Mortgage Risk:</span> The mortgage risk is always encountered by Lending Club when making deals with <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">supply chain</span> related businesses or projects. As shown in Figure 2, the collaterals provided by crowdlending company borrowers may be subject to the risk of frequent <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">variations</span> in mortgage values, which might have an impact on the liquidation of the mortgage. Furthermore, inadequate inventory management would greatly increase the risk of mortgage <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">deterioration</span>, particularly for supply chains related to food and fruit.

<div align=center><img src=" /images/14.png " width="45%"></div>

<center>Figure 2: Current Financing Model of Lending Club</center>

$\color{DarkGoldenRod}{(3)}$ <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Account Risk:</span> The account risk is severe when making deals with companies from traditional industries. Numerous traditional businesses still use paper bills or currency since <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">informatization</span> and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">electronization</span> are not common in those industries, which leaves room for many businesses to make counterfeits. From 80% of the Lending Club fraud cases where <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">accounts receivable</span> were used as collateral, the untraceability of these debts comes from the fact that part of the account receivables are bad debts and the rest of those are sourced from fictitious firms or corporations that have been written off.

To resolve the above risks, we mainly focus on the modification of current <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">credit investigation</span> system in terms of 3 aspects: <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">clients grading</span>, <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">loans judgement</span>, and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">intelligent interest rate setting</span>. 

$\color{DarkGoldenRod}{(1)}$ <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Clients Grading:</span> The current approach either solely uses loan history to arbitrarily determine creditworthiness or treats every borrower as a new client, feeding data directly into neural-nets models without taking into account the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">interpretation</span> of clients. However, 36% of the clients signed up for Lending Club without having a loan history over the previous five years, which results in a great erroneous judgement for <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">new clients</span> - also the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">main task</span> we predominate in for client grading. After appropriate feature engineering, we collected 200+ client related features including salary, region, accumulated loan amount, etc. Then, we used <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">multiple-means type clustering</span> methods on these features to create clusters and then explained these clusters to create client portraits, which can also be used as a key feature in loan judgements and assist those in charge of setting interest rates in better interpreting clients, whether in an automated or manual manner.

<div align=center><img src=" /images/15.png " width="75%"></div>

<center>Figure 3: Our Online Co-training AI Platform</center>

$\color{DarkGoldenRod}{(2)}$ <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Loans judgement:</span> Based on the Lending Club's current algorithms, we ameliorated the training process of data mining by shifting current <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">offline</span> platform to an <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">online co-training</span> AI platform with more stochastic algorithms involved, which also resolved the aforementioned <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">new client</span> problem. The term <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">"Co-training"</span> refers to a training approach that enables the online training of several parties using distributed devices, protecting data privacy while enhancing training effectiveness using numerous delicate Few-Shot Learning (FSL) techniques. After numerous iterations of online distributed FSL data mining, as shown in Figure 3, the generated demo versions are integrated to make <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">adversarial trainings</span> in the co-training AI platform, from which the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">customized</span> AI-driven loan judgement product was derived. In comparison to the previous AI training process, our online co-training AI scheme greatly improved the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">data utilization</span> and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">accelerated</span> the training process through online FSL training under high data security.

$\color{DarkGoldenRod}{(3)}$ <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Intelligent interest rate setting:</span> Due to the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">subjectivity</span> of manual interest rate setting, we developed an intelligent system that <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">automatically</span> generates reference <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">interest rates</span> to assist interest rate setters. After removing the loan data that was significantly impacted by <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">macroeconomic</span> factors, such as the P2P financial crisis, we chose the data of clients who are considered to have a high risk of defaulting on loans or who have a history of defaulting on loans with other financial institutions, but who have never defaulted and have a high <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">second visit</span> rate with Lending Club. Also, the chosen data are situated in a time where the number of clients has significantly increased. Then, we regarded the chosen interest rate as relatively reasonable and rational, and set it as <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">predictor</span> to train on our AI platform to develop a customized AI product for determining interest rates. Fortunately, compared to the previous 5 years, the interest rate set by the intelligent system has lowered by <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">35%</span> in average, and more new clients are therefore involved.

Through our modification on the current credit investigation system, the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">credit risk</span> of the Lending Club has been greatly decreased. Similiar supply chain financing strategies that I described in the previous <a href="https://yilingu0094.github.io/industry_project/#1-supply-chain-finance-project-for-yinan-yunqin-technology-company">Supply Chain Finance Project for Yinan Yunqin Technology Company</a> can be used to address the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">mortgage risk</span> and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">account risk</span>, as illustrated in Figure 4.

**Project Achievements:** The main achievements of this project can be summarized as follows.

1. Identified the main <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">credit</span> issue for Lending Club, the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">new client</span> loan judgement, and successfully resolved it through <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">client grading</span> and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">loan judgement</span>. Also successfully addressed the mortgage risk and account risk by mature supply chain financing strategy and built the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">first intelligent interest rate</span> setting system semi-automatically applied in P2P industry.

2. Avoid using massive data blindly and neural-net models without interpretation; instead, implemented some most recent research achievements like <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">FSL</span> and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">online co-training</span> AI platforms, which significantly reduced the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">sample size</span> requirements, improved data <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">utilization</span>, and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">accelerated</span> training process while maintaining high data <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">security</span>.

3. After applying our AI-driven loan financing strategy, the Lending Club was able to <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">cut</span> its bad loan rate by <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">48%</span> in 2020 compared to the previous year.

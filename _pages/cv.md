## 1. Supply Chain Finance Project for Yinan Yunqin Technology Company

**Background:** With 25% of the country's poultry production, Yinan County is regarded as the pillar county for national poultry processing in China. Yinan's chattel supply chain presently contributes 70% of the county's total GDP, which exceeds 2 billion dollars. However, many poultry companies in Yinan, particularly small and medium-sized companies like startup businesses, continue to grow slowly and consistently run into financial difficulties.

<center>Figure 1: Financial difficulties of many startup poultry companies in Yinan</center>

The primary cause of this funding shortage is the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">low credit</span> of these startup poultry companies. Given the inadequacy of assessable assets and financing amount of these companies, financial institutions are less motivated to offer these businesses supply chain finance services because of a <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">disproportion</span> on their input and output efforts. Additionally, there are still many systemic problems and structural issues in the current guarantee systems, which are vulnerable in risk resistence when the bad loans of some start-ups emerge. 

We, the [Shenzhen Finance Institute (SFI)](https://sfi.cuhk.edu.cn/en) system analysis group, are fortunate to have been given the opportunity by the [China Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (CASME)](http://www.ca-sme.org/) to provide the supply chain financial service for a startup company called <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Yinan Yunqin Technology Company</span> to resolve their financial issues and construct a <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">risk management information system</span> for both Yunan and financial institutions to prevent the aforementioned credit risk.

**Project Description:** In this project, we establish the supply chain finance approach in two key terms: <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">chattel mortgage financing</span> and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">accounts receivable financing</span>, which make it easier for Yinan Yunqin Technology company to finance and reduce the potential risk of financial institutions at the same time.

$\color{DarkGoldenRod}{(1)}$ <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Chattel Mortgage Financing:</span> In the chattel mortgage financing service, when the Yunqin stockyard have a financial need, the financial institution can set the frozen stocks of the stockyard as mortgage in the third-party warehouse. The main steps of chattel mortgage financing are shown as follows,


<div align=center><img src=" /images/08.png " width="80%"></div>

<center>Figure 2:  Chattel Mortgage Financing Model</center>

Firstly, the stockyard makes finance applications to our CASME Platform for matching appropriate financial institutions <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod"><font size=3>$(①)$</font></span>. Then, the CASME assists in matching financial institutions that are prepared to finance and introduces the primary financing process to the partner agency of the matched institutions <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod"><font size=3>$(②)$</font></span>. After credit checking, the financial institution works along with a third-party warehouse that manages the stockyard's mortgage until the financial contract expires <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod"><font size=3>$(③④)$</font></span>. Following agreement, the stockyard is requested to give a mortgage for the same amount as the loan's capital, which will be deposited in the warehouse until repayment <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod"><font size=3>$(⑤⑥)$</font></span>. To entice more financial institutions to join this project, the CASME buys bad loan risk insurance for each financial institution enrolled in this platform. The insurance provider will reimburse the financial institution when a bad loan materializes <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod"><font size=3>$(⑦)$</font></span>. Then, the financial institution provides the stockyard with funds so that the stockyard are capable to purchase necessary production materials <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod"><font size=3>$(⑧⑨)$</font></span>. Ultimately, the stockyard pays off the loan and receives the mortgage before the deadline, and the financial institution cancels its agreement with the third-party warehouse and CASME. Otherwise, the financial institution can liquidate all of the mortgages <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod"><font size=3>$(⑩⑪⑫⑬)$</font></span>.

A special case for chattel mortgage finance is <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Forage Finance</span> shown in Figure 3. We encourage the financial institution to work with forage shops (or other similar businesses) so that financial institutions can directly finance stockyard <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">forage</span> instead of <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">capital</span>, in order to avoid the stockyard from claiming the value of loan capital consumption to exceed real credit. Through this approach, financial institutions would only be responsible for making repayments to the forage shop once the stockyard had declared their production-level requirements.

$\color{DarkGoldenRod}{(2)}$ <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Accounts Receivable Financing:</span> Much like the chattel mortgage financing service, the accounts receivable financing service also provides stockyard financing solutions shown in Figure 4.  In order to enhance the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">liquidity</span> of mortgage, the collateral is changed from <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">frozen inventories</span> to <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">accounts receivable of downstream clients</span>. However, this service largely depends on the development and use of <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">information accounting systems</span>; otherwise, the operational risk of accounts receivable monitoring and retracing exists.

<center>Figure 4:  Accounts Receivable Financing Model</center>

Even with the aforementioned supply chain finance approaches, this platform still faces some significant difficulties as shown in Figure 5. Firstly, it might be difficult for other supply chain participants to be aware of some existing transactions between different parties, so the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">information sharing</span> is <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">insufficient</span>. Furthermore, it is also challenging to spot fraud since not all of the organizations disclose the transactions.

Therefore, an updated platform must be developed to enable transparency in data exchange and information sharing. <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">Blockchain technology</span> can be leveraged to create a supply chain financial platform to address the issue of insufficient data sharing. The blockchain's <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">distributed</span> and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">decentralized</span> characteristics facilitate audits and monitoring, and its <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">immutability</span> also aids financial institutions in risk management.

<center>Figure 6:  Data Flow Graph with Blockchain</center>

After integrating <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">blockchain</span> with the existing system, we can find several benefits from the information flow in Figure 6 and the issues we previously discussed can be resolved. Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain and is <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">traceable</span> since the blockchain platform receives all the transaction data. As a result, <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">any</span> companies can readily request <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">access</span> and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">query</span> to all transaction records, which enhances the trust among all the parties. In the meanwhile, if any fraud or error occurs, all the information can be traced, allowing us to determine who should be held accountable. 

**Project Achievements:** The main achievements of this project can be summarized as follows.

1. With <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">blockchain technology</span>, developed an integrated supply chain finance and risk management information system for YunQin and related upstream and downstream companies in the poultry supply chain, from which successfully managed financing transactions in a <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">low risk</span> way throughout the entire supply chain, including the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">electronization</span> of accounts receivables, creditor's rights, repayment, inventory management, etc.

2. Realized the <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">synergistic benefits</span>, <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">information transparency</span> and <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">effective resource exchanges</span> (more resources with more enterprises engaging in the future) among the poultry companies, suppliers, and financial institutions, which helped YunQin overcome its financial crisis and boost its overall profit by <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">65%</span> over the first two quarters of 2021.

3. This project has been scored as <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">5.00/5.00</span> by the advisor Mr. Shen Zhenyuan from CASME.

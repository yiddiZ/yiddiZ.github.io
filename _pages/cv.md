## 1. Stochastic Algorithm for Nonsmooth Nonconvex-Nonconcave Minmax Problem

**Background:** The nonconvex-nonconcave minmax problem is an important issue arising in operations management and machine learning theory. For example, many operational objectives are formulated in a minmax setting $\min_{x}\max_{y}f(x,y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are real-valued vectors and $f$ is neither (necessarily) convex in $x$ nor (necessarily) concave in $y$. Without solid assumptions on $f$, this problem might be intractable. However, it might be even trickier with complicated constraints for $(x,y)$. There are also a few classical applications for nonconvex-nonconcave minmax problem in machine learning theory, such as the training of generative adversarial networks (GANs) or robust neural-nets. The typical Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) objective is defined as the minimization of the Wasserstein distance between the discriminator $D_y$ of the true distribution $b$ and that of the one learnt by the generator $G_x$ as follows,

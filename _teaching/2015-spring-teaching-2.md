The [Global Management Challenge (GMC)](https://globalmanagementchallenge.pt/worldgmc/) is a global strategic operations management competition that runs with a complex computer simulation system, in which each team runs different virtual company in the same market environment, and competes by developing and producing products that can better meet customer needs to maximize their investment performance. Since 2019, I have become the instructor for this workshop and take in charge of the graduate and undergraduate instruction for two semesters (2019 & 2020 Fall).

+ In this workshop, I mainly taught the basic rules and insights of this competition, concepts and theory of operation management, strategic data-driven decision making, decision model building, the application of basic machine learning tools on data mining, etc.

+ As the workshop instructor, I held the workshop for 2 years (once a week), and successfully educated and trained over 600 students. Among all the students, one group of students won the world champion title, 12 groups participated the national final and won the first prize, and 46 groups won the second prize.

The [Global Management Challenge (GMC)](https://globalmanagementchallenge.pt/worldgmc/) is a global strategic operations management competition that runs with a complex computer simulation system, in which each team runs different virtual company in the same market environment, and competes by developing and producing products that can better meet customer needs to maximize their investment performance. Since 2019, I have become the instructor for this workshop and take in charge of the graduate and undergraduate instruction for two semesters (2019 & 2020 Fall).
